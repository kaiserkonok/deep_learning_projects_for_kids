## ðŸ”¹ Odd One Out

**Task:**  
Given 3 integers where 2 are the same and 1 is different, predict the index (0, 1, or 2) of the odd one.

**Examples:**
- `[5, 5, 9] â†’ 2`
- `[3, 7, 3] â†’ 1`
- `[2, 2, 2] â†’ (excluded)`

**Input:** 3 normalized numbers  
**Output:** Class label (0, 1, or 2)

**Use Case:** Simple classification to focus on learning logic with dense layers.
